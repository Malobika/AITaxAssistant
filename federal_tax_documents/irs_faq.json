  "question": "How do I notify the IRS my address has changed?",
  "answer": "There are several ways to notify the IRS of an address change:\n\n1. IRS Form: Submit Form 8822 (Change of Address) or Form 8822-B (Change of Address or Responsible Party - Business).\n2. Tax return: Use your new address when filing your next tax return.\n3. Written statement: Send the IRS a signed statement with your full name, old and new addresses, and Social Security number (SSN), ITIN, or EIN, to the address where you filed your last return.\n4. Oral notification: Inform the IRS in person or by phone (have your identity information ready to verify your identity and address on file).\n\nNotes:\n- If you filed jointly and still live with your spouse, both must provide names, SSNs, new address, and signatures on the form or statement.\n- If you have separate addresses after a joint filing, each person should notify the IRS individually.\n- Authorized representatives changing an address must attach power of attorney (Form 2848). Unauthorized third parties cannot change a taxpayer's address.\n- Notifying the USPS may update the IRS address, but not all post offices forward government checks, so direct IRS notification is recommended.\n- Address changes for employment tax returns generate confirmation notices (148A and 148B) to both addresses.\n- Changes typically process in 4-6 weeks.\n\nFor more information, see Revenue Procedure 2010-16."

  "id": "faq_irs_transcript_w2_002",
  "question": "Can I get a transcript or copy of Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, from the IRS?",
  "answer": "Yes, you can get a transcript or a copy of Form W-2 from the IRS, but with limitations:\n\nTranscript:\n- You can obtain a wage and income transcript (which includes federal tax information reported by your employer) from the IRS online at the 'Get your tax records and transcripts' page or by using Form 4506-T. Check the 'Form W-2' box, specify the needed tax year(s), and mail or fax the completed form. Most requests process within 10 business days. IRS transcripts may be available for up to 10 years, but the current year transcript may be incomplete if your earnings haven't been fully reported yet. These transcripts do not include any state or local tax info. For W-2 details needed for retirement, contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) at 800-772-1213.\n\nCopy:\n- If you e-filed your tax return or didn't attach your Form W-2 to your paper return, use the transcript options above, or contact your employer or SSA for a copy. Your employer is usually the fastest source for your current year W-2. If you cannot get it from your employer and you attached it to a previous paper tax return, you can order a copy of the entire tax return (including the W-2) for a fee using Form 4506. Processing takes about 75 calendar days. The fee is waived for federally declared disaster victims (see Publication 3067). For more, see IRS Topic 159."

  "question": "Can I file an amended Form 1040-X electronically?",
  "answer": "Yes, you can file Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, electronically using tax filing software for the current year and two prior tax periods, provided your original return was filed electronically. If the return you are amending was originally filed on paper, the amended return must also be filed on paper. Even if you filed your original return electronically, you may still file a paper 1040-X if you wish. Always follow the official instructions for preparing and filing either electronic or paper Form 1040-X. For more details, see the IRS Form 1040-X Frequently Asked Questions, Instructions for Form 1040-X, and Tax Topic 308 — Amended returns."

  "question": "Is there an age limit on claiming my child as a dependent?",
  "answer": "To claim your child as a dependent, your child must meet either the qualifying child test or the qualifying relative test:\n\n- For the qualifying child test: your child must be younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly) and either younger than 19 years old, or a student younger than 24 years old as of the end of the tax year.\n- There is no age limit if your child is permanently and totally disabled, or if they qualify as a relative under the qualifying relative test.\n\nIn addition, the dependent taxpayer test, citizen or resident test, and joint return test must also be met for anyone you claim as a dependent.\n\nFor more information, see: 'Whom may I claim as a dependent?' and IRS Publication 501."

  "id": "faq_irs_lost_refund_check_006",
  "question": "I lost my refund check. How do I get a new one?",
  "answer": "If you lost your refund check, you should initiate a refund trace. You can use the 'Where's My Refund' tool online, call the automated system at 800-829-1954, or speak with an IRS representative at 800-829-1040 (check telephone assistance for hours of operation). If you filed a married filing jointly return, you cannot start a trace with automated systems—you must speak with a representative or download and complete Form 3911 (Taxpayer Statement Regarding Refund).\n\nYour claim will be processed in one of two ways:\n- If the check wasn't cashed, you'll receive a replacement check after the original is canceled.\n- If the check was cashed, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) will provide a claim package with a copy of the cashed check. Follow all instructions to complete the claim. BFS will review your claim and the signature on the canceled check before deciding if a new refund can be issued. The review may take up to six weeks."

  "id": "faq_irs_incorrect_w2_007",
  "question": "I received an incorrect Form W-2. My former employer won’t issue me a corrected Form W-2. What should I do?",
  "answer": "If your employer will not issue a corrected Form W-2 by the end of February, you can request that the IRS initiate a Form W-2 complaint. Call the IRS at 800-829-1040 or make an appointment at a taxpayer assistance center (TAC). The IRS will send your employer a letter requesting they issue a corrected Form W-2 within ten days, and will send you Form 4852 (Substitute for Form W-2) with instructions. Use Form 4852 if your employer fails to provide a corrected W-2 in time to file your tax return; you will estimate your wages and withholdings based on your final pay stub if possible. There may be refund processing delays while the IRS verifies your information. Retain a copy of Form 4852 for your records. If you later receive a corrected W-2 showing different information than your return, file an amended return (Form 1040-X). Have your employer’s name and address and your personal details ready when you contact the IRS. For more information, see IRS Topic 154, Topic 308, and details on how to correct    your Social Security earnings."

  "id": "faq_irs_w2_vs_1099_008",
  "question": "What's the difference between a Form W-2 and a Form 1099-MISC or Form 1099-NEC?",
  "answer": "Although these forms are all called information returns, they serve different purposes. Employers use Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, to report wages, tips, or other compensation paid to employees, along with taxes withheld (income, Social Security, and Medicare), to both the employee and the Social Security Administration (SSA). The SSA shares this data with the IRS. In contrast, payers use Form 1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Information) and/or Form 1099-NEC (Nonemployee Compensation) to report various payments made in the course of business, usually to non-employees. Examples include: payments of $600 or more to non-employees for services (Form 1099-NEC), rents, prizes, awards, royalties, or attorney fees (Form 1099-MISC), backup withholding, and sales of $5,000 or more for resale. Payers file Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC with the IRS and provide copies to the recipients. For more information, see IRS Tax Topic 752 and the instructions for Forms W-2, W-3, 1099-MISC, and 1099-NEC."

  "id": "faq_irs_inherited_property_taxable_009",
  "question": "Is money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income?",
  "answer": "Generally, money received from the sale of inherited property may be taxable. The gross proceeds from the sale are reported on your tax return if you have a filing requirement. To determine if you owe tax, you must first figure your basis in the inherited property—usually the fair market value (FMV) on the date of the decedent's death, or on an alternate valuation date if chosen by the executor of the estate on Form 706. If you sell the property for more than your basis, you have a taxable gain, which must be reported on Schedule D (Form 1040) and Form 8949. For FMV information, contact the executor of the estate. A law passed in 2015 often requires your basis to be consistent with the value used for Federal estate tax; you may receive a Schedule A to Form 8971. If you use a basis higher than the estate tax value, accuracy-related penalties may apply. For more information, see IRS Tax Topic 703, Publication 550, Publication 559, Publication 551, and Notice 2016-27."
